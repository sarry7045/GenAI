pip freeze > requirements.txt
python install -r requirements.txt
.\venv\Scripts\activate - for activate the venv

uvicorn ollama_api:app  --port 8000 - to start the fastApi app
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/default/chat_chat_post - URL of fastApi app

uv - pip install uv, uv init project-name, uv run main.py, ud add package_name, uv build
Suppose if we want to run project without installing the dependencies - uv run --with 'fastApi' main.py

docker compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up - for Run the docker Image
docker compose -f docker-compose.graph.yml up


Vector Embeddings - It will Break the words in Some code like suppose in ChatGPT - Hey Hi Suraj - It wil Convert into one Code like [123, 56, 89201]
Context window - Means LLM k kitna Previous chat ka context save krke rakh sakta hai
Enrichment Node - User Query lo and uske aur bhi queries banao using multiple LLM Models for Good and Accurate Questions
Query Translation > Routing (Logical Routing) - Measn LLM will decide ki usko kaha se data uthana hai based on User Query (Currect Data Source , Currect Model)
Semantic Routing - For some specific Topics
Checkpointer - A Checkpointer is a tool or system to save and restore model states during training or inference
Guardrails and Security - Suppose any user give there personal info like, Bank info, Password n all in the prompt, or user tries to talk to AI for some violent things to avoid this things we can use Guardrails methods.  
Step Back Prompting - Improvement of User Prompts
Solve the issue and Judge the Response - Techique

Neo4J - Specialized for Graphs - Knowledge Graph
Flux - Is a Transforer for the convert text to image
mem0AI - The memory Layer for Our AI Agents
Qdrant - Vector Database

Fine Tuning - Existing Model ko apne hisab se aur train krna, Time Consuming, Costly, Not Possible to Train Everyday or Week
RAG - Give the LLM's to Some real time data context and Train Accordinaly

LangChain - Gives Builded functions/Solutions like, Convert pdf in chunks n all
LangSmith - for Tracking our API Key usage, User prompt a to z details of user attraction, Cost of Promt Response n all
LangFuse - Free Alternative of LangSmith 
LangGraph - It Says ki aap harr chiz ko or code ko ek graph k form me structure karo - Code Block then Define Flow

MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol) - Basicaly we can say it's a standard of Making AI Agent - Example : RestFul API's
A2A - Example: You seen (Login with google) Button everywhere but once we try to login it will Redirect to the same login page of Google, that means the Solution or Context is same for all, But Product is one.



Controlled Autonomous Flow
LORA, Quantization , QLORA
What is the difference between streaming and non-streaming responses in LLMs


RAG - Example : Refer Some External Information (Other Vector Database - Everthing is stored in a form of Vector Embeddings)
Fine Tuning - Suppose LLM does'nt have the context of some Topic so we can train the LLM with that data and conetxt
AI Agent - In Case if we ask some question to LLM and LLM does'nt have the data access foe that so it will call some tools related to that Question - Example Weather, Stock market Price
Agentic AI - Convert YT Video to Blog - There is a multiple steps to complete this task , then we need to create multiple AI Agent for specific tasks - Multiple Agents Collabrating Each Other
Standard models - Prediction based on large datasets
Reasoning models - Focus on Logic , Problem Solving, Understaing Relationships
Embeddings and - Embeddings are numerical representations of data points
Vector Search - Vector search then uses these embeddings to find data points that are similar to a given query
Multiple Agent - Example Traffic light - Milke Kaam krna


Ideas for AI Agents : Gym MemberShip Checker, Something about Stock Market, Meeting analyzer, Doctors Precreption, PR Review by AI, Resume check and give the Interview questions
